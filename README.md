# GroupInn

## A Digital Home for Communities

GroupInn helps people discover, join, and grow meaningful groups around shared interest without needing to share phone numbers or social media handles.


_________________________  OVERVIEW  _________________________


GroupInn provides a simple, organized space where people can connect through groups.  
Each group acts as a small, private community where members can chat, share ideas, and build meaningful relationships.

The goal is to make group interactions easy, safe, and human — focusing on connection rather than complexity.
